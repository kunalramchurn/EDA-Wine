# Exploratory Data Analysis-Wine Dataset

Context: This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and the features were web-scraped from a well-known website to Wine Conoisseurs known as Vivino.com.
The role of this EDA is to identify significant patterns and trends in wine consumption based on features such as ratings, number of ratings, and price. and provide useful insights on wine production over a lifespan of 60 years.The analysis is broken down into 4 parts:

1. Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset key features and data types.
2. Data Transformation: In this section, we will clean the dataset by removing outliers and missing values and check for duplicates,skewness and peakedness of distribution.
3. EDA: After the dataset has been preprocessed, we can now visualize the variables.
4. Main insights/Key Take-aways: A quick conclusion summarizing the main points behind the analysis.

#### Content of this notebook
1. Dataset exploration: 

- Understanding, preparing and defining data and its data type.
- Features exploration
- Descriptive statistics of the numerical features
- Dataset Screening: Check for Null,duplicate values and kernel optimization


2. Data Transformation(Preparing Data before EDA): 
- Data preprocessing and cleaning: Steps necessary to optimize the dataset before perfoming EDA 
- Outlier/Anomaly detection analysis 

3. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): 
- Non-Graphical Analysis
- Visualizing Categorical features
- Graphical Univariate Analysis(visualizing the distribution of 1 feature) and search for Skewness in individual key features
- Graphical Bivariate Analysis(Visualizing relationship between 2 features)
- Graphical Multivariate Analysis(Visualzing relationship between multiple features)

4. Main Insights/ Key Take-aways
